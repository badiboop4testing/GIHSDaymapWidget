# Installation
Please note that GIHS Daymap Widget is still under development; **please expect some minor bugs**. You can always report issues in the issues tab. Also note that this has only been tested on Windows. If you are on Mac, this may not work.

Before using GIHS Daymap Widget, you must install the following apps:
- Lively Wallpaper
- TurboWarp Desktop (alternatively, you can use the web version)
- VS Code or Notepad

### Setting up the widget
1. Download the files ```Template.json``` and ```Dayplan.sb3``` from the ```main``` branch. Open up template.json in VS Code or Notepad, then replace the placeholders with your lessons and class codes.
2. Open TurboWarp Deskop and go ```File>Load from your computer```. Upload ```Dayplan.sb3``` and wait for it to load. Once it finishes, press the green flag at then hold down ```Shift-O```, then select your edited ```Template.json```.
3. If you would like to use your own custom wallpaper, you can edit the ```Wallpaper``` sprite. If you leave it, you'll use the default wallpaper.
4. Wait a few seconds before pressing the red stop button to stop the project. In the top right hand corner, press the button that says ```Save to your computer```.
### Creating the wallpaper
Use the TurbWarp Packager (https://packager.turbowarp.org/) to generate an html file for your wallpaper. Upload ```Dayplan.sb3```, and make sure you exactly copy these settings:
